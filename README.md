# Data_Analyst_Nanodegree
This repository includes four projects below completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

1. Movie Data Analysis - The most loved genres over the last 55 years and the factors correlated with movies' revenue
2. AB Test for a new webpage launch
3. WeRateDogs - Data Wrangling Project
4. Ford GoBike - Data Visualization Project

## Project Description

### Project 1 - TMDb Movie Data
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) including many features such as user ratings, budget, cast, director, genres, release year, revenue, and so on. In this project, 5 steps of the data analysis process are carried out, Ask questions -> Wrangle data -> Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) -> Draw conclusions (or even make predictions) -> Communicate the results. The most loved movie genres are studied followed by the investigation of the factors that affect the movie's revenue.

### Project 2 - A/B Test
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these. For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Project 3 - WeRateDogs
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.  
The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

### Project 4 - Ford GoBike
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.  
In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.  
In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.  
The data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
